WhatsApp "Web" (WAW) API c# concept, lib and proto (draft / sketch only)

## What is WAW

WAW is the concept / lib / proto used some Whatsapp Business analogue (some WA gateway to send / recieve WA message).
I suddenly found this things:
- https://lite.wanesia.com
- https://wanesia.id

This Indonesian WA "service" gives to any developer some good test 1-year period (12000 rp. as start bonus, 1000 rp. / mo. as 1 device use). I found this "budget scheme" useful. :)

## What is Wanesia Lite API
Wanesia Lite API is a base for future "SDK" built to interact with [WhatsappWeb](https://web.whatsapp.com/). This means that no browser, application or any additional software is necessary to use this API. 
This library was built for [Wanesia Lite API v4](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6039046/Uz5NjYyE). 

## Steps of RnD
- Register at https://lite.wanesia.com, add your phone device, get token
- Use Postman for some POST requests (i.e., https://lite.wanesia.com/api/send_message).
- Research web hooks theme and try to POST Webhook (you need to have http://www.yourdomain.com/callback.php)
