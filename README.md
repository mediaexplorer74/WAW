WebWhatsApp API c# lib (proto / draft / sketch only)

## What is WAW

WAW is the only myth, only idea to port WhatsappWeb4j from pure Java over to C#... but idk Java at all :(

## What is WhatsappWeb4j
WhatsappWeb4j is a standalone library built to interact with [WhatsappWeb](https://web.whatsapp.com/). This means that no browser, application or
any additional software is necessary to use this library. This library was built for [Java 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/). 

## Referencies

## Help me if You can...
If you know Java + C#, you're welcome. Feel free to fork / port / PR, etc.
